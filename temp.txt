Suppose you have n courses and m rooms. Number of students in each course and size of each room is available. 
You need to maximize the number of courses that could be allocated classrooms at the same time. 
That is how many courses can simultaneously happen at a time. 

You are given the root of a binary tree. 
We install cameras on the tree nodes where each camera at a node can monitor its parent, 
itself, and its immediate children.
